# Fix for Nullable Boolean Errors in HyperVCreator

The main issue in the build is that there were several instances where a nullable boolean (bool?) was being combined with a non-nullable boolean (bool) using the && operator. This is not allowed in C#. Here are the changes to fix these issues:

## 1. Create a Helper Extension Method

First, add a new extension method to `PowerShellExtensions.cs` that safely checks if a nullable boolean is true:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Safely checks if a PowerShellResult was successful
/// </summary>
/// <param name="result">The PowerShellResult</param>
/// <returns>True if Success is true, false otherwise</returns>
public static bool WasSuccessful(this PowerShellResult result)
{
    return result?.Success == true;
}
```

Also, update the `ContainsOutput` method to include a null check:

```csharp
public static bool ContainsOutput(this PowerShellResult result, string value)
{
    if (result == null)
        return false;
        
    return result.GetOutputStrings().Any(s => s.Contains(value, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
}
```

## 2. Update HyperVService.cs

Replace all instances of `result.Success &&` with `result.WasSuccessful() &&` in the following methods:

- `CreateVirtualMachineAsync`
- `CreateVirtualMachine`
- `ConfigureNetwork`
- `AddVirtualDisk`
- `MountISOFile`
- `StartVM`
- `StopVM`
- `CheckHyperVEnabled`

For example, change:
```csharp
return result.Success && result.ContainsOutput("VM creation succeeded");
```

To:
```csharp
return result.WasSuccessful() && result.ContainsOutput("VM creation succeeded");
```

## 3. Update ConfigurationService.cs

Replace all instances of `result.Success &&` with `result.WasSuccessful() &&` in the following methods:

- `ConfigureDomainController`
- `ConfigureRDSH`
- `ConfigureFileServer`
- `ConfigureWebServer`
- `ConfigureSQLServer`
- `ConfigureDHCPServer`
- `ConfigureDNSServer`

## 4. Fix Other Nullable Reference Warnings

### In TemplateService.cs:

1. Remove the unused field:
```csharp
private readonly PowerShellService _powerShellService;
```

2. Fix the potential null reference on line 304 by using the nullable type:
```csharp
VMTemplate? template = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<VMTemplate>(json, _jsonOptions);
```

### In VMCreationServiceTests.cs:

Add a null check before calling Directory.CreateDirectory:
```csharp
var scriptPath = Path.Combine(_scriptsDirectory, "RoleConfiguration", "CustomVM.ps1");
var directoryPath = Path.GetDirectoryName(scriptPath);

// Ensure directory exists before creating the file
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(directoryPath))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(directoryPath);
}
```

## Summary of Changes

The main problem was attempting to use the logical AND operator (&&) between a nullable boolean (`bool?`) and a non-nullable boolean (`bool`), which isn't allowed in C#. We fixed this by creating an extension method that safely checks if a nullable boolean is true, then updated all the places where this pattern was used.

We also fixed a few other nullable reference warnings by adding null checks and using the nullable type annotations where appropriate.
