- [x] Main application window with navigation
- [x] Theme system with three themes (Classic, Dark, Sanrio)
- [x] Settings persistence
- [x] Template management system

### Server Role Configuration UIs
- [x] Domain Controller configuration form
- [x] Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) configuration form
- [x] SQL Server configuration form
- [x] File Server configuration form

### PowerShell Integration
- [x] PowerShell script execution service
- [x] Role-specific deployment scripts
- [x] Unattended XML templates for different server roles

## Current Task Status

We have successfully implemented the File Server configuration form and integrated it into the main application navigation. The form allows users to configure:

1. Basic VM settings (CPU, memory, disk size)
2. Data disks with custom sizes, labels, and file systems
3. Network shares with permissions
4. File Server features (FSRM, quotas, deduplication, shadow copies)
5. Network configuration (DHCP or static IP)
6. Domain integration for joining the file server to a domain

The main application menu and navigation have been updated to enable File Server configuration, making it easy for users to access this functionality.

## Next Steps

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement the Web Server configuration form
2. Create the DHCP Server configuration form
3. Implement the DNS Server configuration form
4. Add validation for all configuration forms

### Medium Term (2-4 weeks)
1. Complete remaining server role forms (DHCP, DNS)
2. Finalize VM creation and deployment workflow
3. Implement progress monitoring and feedback
4. Add detailed error handling

### Long Term (1-2 months)
1. Complete automated testing
2. Create installation package
3. Prepare documentation
4. Release first version

## Current Roadmap Status

According to our detailed roadmap:
- Phase 1 (Planning and Design): 90% complete
- Phase 2 (Development): 75% complete
- Phase 3 (Testing and Deployment): 20% complete

The application is now ready for functional testing of the implemented server role configurations (Domain Controller, RDSH, SQL Server).

## Summary of Today's Work

Today we successfully implemented the File Server configuration UI with the following components:

1. Created the FileServerConfigViewModel with comprehensive properties for all configuration aspects:
   - Basic VM settings (name, CPU, memory, disk)
   - Data disk management with custom sizes and file systems
   - Network share configuration with permissions
   - File Server features (FSRM, quotas, deduplication, shadow copies)
   - Network and domain integration settings

2. Implemented the FileServerConfigView XAML interface with:
   - User-friendly input forms organized by category
   - Interactive lists for disks and shares management
   - Controls that respond to user selections (conditional visibility)
   - Consistent styling matching the application theme

3. Integrated the File Server configuration into the main application:
   - Added navigation commands in MainWindowViewModel
   - Updated the main menu and sidebar navigation
   - Enabled the File Server tile on the home screen

4. Updated project documentation:
   - Marked File Server implementation as complete in the roadmap
   - Updated README progress section
   - Created this detailed progress report

The File Server UI implementation completes another significant milestone in the roadmap, bringing us closer to a fully functional application. With this addition, users can now configure and create File Server VMs with customized storage solutions.
