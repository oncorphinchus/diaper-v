# Hyper-V VM Creation Application - Project Overview

## Purpose and Vision

The Hyper-V VM Creation Application aims to streamline the process of creating pre-configured virtual machines in Microsoft Hyper-V. The application addresses the pain points of manual VM configuration by providing role-based templates that automate the setup of common server roles. This reduces human error, saves time, and ensures consistency across virtual machine deployments.

## Target Audience

- **System Administrators**: Professionals managing Windows infrastructure who need to rapidly deploy consistent VMs
- **IT Professionals**: Users with some Hyper-V knowledge who want to simplify repetitive VM creation tasks
- **Developers**: Technical users who need testing environments with specific server configurations

## Value Proposition

- **Time Savings**: Reduce VM deployment time by up to 80% through automation
- **Consistency**: Ensure all VMs are created with standardized configurations
- **Error Reduction**: Minimize manual configuration errors through templated approaches
- **Accessibility**: Make advanced Hyper-V functionality available to less technical users

## Project Goals

1. Create a user-friendly, visually appealing Windows application
2. Provide automated setup for 7 common server roles
3. Support customization for advanced users
4. Incorporate multiple visual themes for user preference
5. Minimize manual interaction during VM creation
6. Ensure high reliability and error handling

## Key Features

### Role-Based VM Creation
Pre-configured templates for:
- Domain Controllers (DC)
- Remote Desktop Session Hosts (RDSH)
- File Servers
- Web Servers (IIS)
- SQL Servers
- DHCP Servers
- DNS Servers
- Custom VMs (full control)

### Automation Features
- Unattended OS installation via Unattend.xml
- PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) for role setup
- Automated virtual network configuration
- Standardized storage allocation

### User Experience
- Intuitive, wizard-style interface
- Multiple visual themes (Classic, Sanrio, Dark)
- Clear progress monitoring
- Detailed error reporting

## Technology Stack

- **UI Framework**: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **VM Automation**: PowerShell
- **OS Installation**: Unattend.xml
- **Configuration Management**: PowerShell DSC
- **Data Storage**: JSON/XML configuration files or SQLite
- **Deployment**: WiX Toolset for MSI creation

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create fully functional role-based VMs with minimal input
2. The application correctly configures all 7 planned server roles
3. VM creation time is significantly reduced compared to manual methods
4. Users report high satisfaction with the interface and themes
5. The application handles errors gracefully with useful feedback
6. Documentation is comprehensive and accessible

## Project Timeline Overview

- **Planning & Design**: 5 weeks
- **Development**: 14 weeks
- **Testing & Deployment**: 4 weeks
- **Total Estimated Duration**: 23 weeks

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Hyper-V API changes | High | Low | Design modular PowerShell integration with abstraction layers |
| Poor user experience | Medium | Medium | Conduct frequent user testing throughout development |
| Server role complexity | High | Medium | Progressive development starting with simpler roles |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Regular performance testing and optimization |
| OS compatibility issues | High | Medium | Test on multiple Windows versions early |
