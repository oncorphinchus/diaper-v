# Documentation Assets

This directory contains images, diagrams, and other visual assets used in the project documentation.

## Organization

Assets should be organized in subdirectories by type:

- `diagrams/`: System and architecture diagrams
- `screenshots/`: Application UI screenshots
- `icons/`: Application icons and visual elements
- `themes/`: Theme-specific visual assets

## Naming Convention

Assets should follow a clear naming convention:

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens (kebab-case)
- Include the document category in the name
- Include a brief description of the content

Examples:
- `architecture-layers-diagram.png`
- `ui-main-window-classic-theme.png`
- `workflow-vm-creation-process.png`

## Diagram Sources

When creating diagrams, store both the rendered image and the source file (if applicable):

- Diagrams: Store both PNG/SVG and the source file (e.g., draw.io XML)
- UI Mockups: Store both PNG/JPG and the source file (e.g., Figma, Sketch)

## Recommended Tools

- Architecture Diagrams: [draw.io](https://draw.io) or [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com)
- UI Mockups: [Figma](https://www.figma.com) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com)
- Screenshots: [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org) or [ShareX](https://getsharex.com)

## Image Guidelines

- Keep file sizes reasonable (compress when appropriate)
- Use appropriate resolution for clarity
- Use consistent styling across related diagrams
- Include alt text in documentation for accessibility
