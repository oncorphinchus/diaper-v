# HyperV Creator Build Issues - Fixed

## Fixed Issues

1. **Duplicate Class Definitions**
   - Removed duplicate PowerShellResult class by renaming one to PowerShellExecutorResult
   - Removed duplicate model classes from TemplateService.cs, keeping only those in the Models namespace

2. **Namespace Issues**
   - Added missing using statements for Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands
   - Updated model class references to explicitly use Models namespace
   - Fixed ambiguity between PowerShellService classes in different namespaces

3. **Constructor Parameter Issues**
   - Fixed ThemeService constructor in tests to match the implementation
   - Updated VMCreationService to use the correct PowerShellService constructor

4. **Type Conversion Issues**
   - Fixed PSDataCollection to Collection conversion by creating a new Collection and copying items

5. **PowerShell Integration**
   - Replaced ExecutionPolicy with AuthorizationManager to avoid compatibility issues
   - Fixed System.Management.Automation.PowerShell.Create() references to avoid ambiguity

## Remaining Issues

1. **Nullable Reference Warnings**
   - These are now treated as warnings rather than errors by setting Nullable to "warnings" in the project file
   - For proper resolution, null checks should be added in the following locations:
     - PowerShellService.cs lines 58, 66, 73 (stream data access)
     - TemplateService.cs line 302 (possible null dereference)

2. **Future Work**
   - Implement proper null checks throughout the codebase
   - Consider adding more unit tests
   - Setup proper CI/CD pipeline for the project

## Testing Process

After making our changes, we ran the following tests:
1. Clean build using CleanAndRebuild.bat
2. Direct build commands on the Core project

## Next Steps

1. Run the application to ensure it functions correctly
2. Address nullable reference warnings by adding proper null checks
3. Conduct thorough testing of all features
