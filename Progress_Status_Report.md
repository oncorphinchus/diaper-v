# Hyper-V Creator Project - Status Report

## Current Progress

### Resolved Issues
- [x] Fixed duplicate class definition issues in PowerShell-related classes
  - Renamed duplicate PowerShellResult class to PowerShellExecutorResult in PowerShellExecutor.cs
  - Maintained proper class structure to avoid conflicts

- [x] Added proper safety checks for IProgress implementation in PowerShellService.cs
  - Updated progress reporting mechanism to use null conditional operators
  - Made progress reporting more robust to handle null values

- [x] Created PowerShellExecutorService to bridge between different implementations
  - Implemented wrapper service to standardize PowerShell execution results
  - Added proper progress reporting support

- [x] Created services required for application functionality
  - Implemented NavigationService for view navigation
  - Implemented ConfigurationService for settings management
  - Implemented HyperVService for VM operations

### Outstanding Issues
- [ ] Build still failing due to various errors
  - Command execution issues prevent detailed diagnostics
  - Nullable reference issues likely still present
  - Possible framework compatibility issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix environment issues causing command execution failures
   - Check PowerShell execution policy
   - Verify .NET SDK installation and version compatibility
   - Ensure all project dependencies are properly installed

2. Complete the build error resolution
   - Update Nullable reference handling in project files
   - Resolve any remaining ambiguous references
   - Fix implementation issues in service classes

3. Create comprehensive test suite
   - Implement unit tests for PowerShell services
   - Test VM creation functionality with mock objects
   - Verify configuration persistence

### Medium-term Actions
1. Complete UI implementation
   - Finalize theme implementation
   - Connect view models to services
   - Implement progress reporting in UI

2. Improve PowerShell integration
   - Enhance error handling and reporting
   - Add script validation before execution
   - Implement cancellation support for long-running operations

## Conclusion
The project has made significant progress in resolving core structural issues and implementing required services. However, build issues persist that need to be addressed before proceeding to testing and UI integration. The next priority is to resolve the build failures and validate the core functionality before proceeding with UI refinements and additional features.
